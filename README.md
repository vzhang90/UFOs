# **UFO Sightings**

## Overview of Project
Utilizing JavaScript and HTML, this project will create a webage with a filtered data table to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings. Users will be able to filter the search based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Results
On the left hand side of the webpage, users will have 5 different search boxes to filter the data table based on date, city, state, country, and shape.

## Summary
This webpage offers a structured way to organize data, comparable to excel's pivot tables. However, a shortcoming of its functionality is that it does not link additional information to each listed UFO sighting.
